Instructions:

1. All files should be in the folder. pytest automatically picks test cases as test_ files has name. So we donot need to separate. 
2. Just open the terminal and go that folder i.e. cd Project_done 
3. Then type pytest 
	a) if there is any error, just use 'pip3 install pytest' 
	b) otherwise it is okay. It shows success test cases. 
Addtional info:
	Source.py has main code and we build three test cases in separate.
